# boreholetools
*VERSION: 0.0.1*
*LAST CHANGE: 09/10/2018*

boreholetools is a collection of modules to QC geoscientific borehole data of various types
* convert/verify/interpolate well trajectory data / deviation surveys
* convert apparent bed dip/dip azimuth information measured within a wellbore to true bed dip/dip azimuth
* calculate true vertical/stratigraphic thickness from well marker files using dip information

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
